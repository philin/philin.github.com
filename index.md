I am currently a graduate student at the 
[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://ece.illinois.edu).
My advisor is 
[Professor Nitin Vaidya](http://users.crhc.illinois.edu/nhv/).
I am currently looking into the consistency guarantee issues
associated with replicated datastores
such as [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).


Feel free to contact me at prlin2 (at) illinois.edu.
