Pronounced "gee-oh" jump, this recently released iOS game from [Code Brewery][3]
has sucked up a lot of my recent free time.
Unlike games which focus mostly on graphics, [G.o Jump][5] is about the gameplay.
Breaking your old high score while enjoying the original 8-bit music is
a wonderful feeling.
Check out a video of the game [here][4].

## Basic Game Play
The game is simple and takes 30 seconds to learn,
but to get a high scoring game will take at least a week.

To play you tilt your iPhone or iPad to move a ball in order to 
avoid falling shapes and jump onto split shapes.
You lose when a shape lands on you, or you bump into one.
Avoiding a shape gets you 1 point, while jumping on a split shape gets
you 2 points.
Additionally, jumping on shapes consecutively will earn you extra combo points.

## Tips
The multiplier is the key to a high scoring game.
To build the multiplier, you need to jump on 3 consecutive shapes to add 1
factor to the multiplier.
Then you have roughly 10 seconds to do it again, or else your multiplier drops
back to 0.

Here are some tips to maintaining and building a high multiplier:

- **Avoid power ups**: although fun, they will destroy your multiplier because
  of how long they last.
- **Time your jumps**: at the lower levels of the game, shapes are relatively rare.
  You should wait wait for a few shapes to appear before you
  jump on the split shapes to get a combo.
- **Anticipation**: shapes split randomly, but if you can
  jump towards the falling shapes as if they were going to break.
  Sometimes you'll just hit the ground, but the rest of the time you can keep
  building your combo.
- **Play conservatively**: since one wrong move and its game over, playing
  conservatively is the best bet.
  If you're considering going for a 3rd jump to increase your multiplier, but
  there is a shape about to fall, you're better off returning to ground and
  waiting for a better opportunity.
- **Perseverance**: it'll seem daunting at first that others are scoring in the
  thousands when you're still trying to break 200 points, but don't give up.
  Due to the nature of the scoring system, the points come exponentially.
  Once you build your multiplier up to 10x, each jump on a shape is worth 20
  points.
  Jump on 3 shapes and with the extra combo points that's almost 100 points right
  there!
  Practice makes perfect, so get playing!
  
Its currently free in the [App Store][1], so I suggest you get it before 
April 3rd or else you'll have to pay the $0.99 (although its well worth it)!
And please leave a review if you liked the game.
